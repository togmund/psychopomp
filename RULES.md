# Psychopomp

Like Charon on the river Styx, the Valkyries of Valhalla, or Anubis of the Duat, psychopomps guide the dead to the afterlife.

Setup:

- 40 Soul Tiles
  - 8 of each of the 5 colors
  - Soul bag
- 40 Soul Cards
  - 8 of each of the 5 colors
- 12 Action / Scoring Cards
- 22 Coins
- 3 Afterlife Boards
  - 3 Deed markers (dice for now)
- 7 Circles

Scoring:

- Most points wins.
- Each afterlife expects three deeds from a soul, represented on the Soul Cards. Each of these Deeds begins at 1 (represetned the three symbols, triangle, circle square).
- Each time you deliver a soul to one of the three afterlifes, count the number of matching colored souls (including the newly delivered soul) and score that many points.
- In order to deliver a soul, it must by worthy of that afterlife. If it is not, you must pay a tax.

- When a soul is brought to an afterlife,

Turn:

- Upkeep
  - Add 1 soul to the river tile from the soul bag
- Sow
  - Pick up all of the souls in any one of the circles.
  - Moving clockwise, deposit one of the souls on each tile until you place the last soul.
    - If you start on the river tile, collect one coin for each soul on the river tile.
    - If you land on (the lighthouses), add 1 soul from the soul bag to the river tile.
    - If you land on the river tile, take the play action again.
- Reap
  - If you landed on a lighthouse tile, take the action on that card or purchase that card.
  - If you land on an afterlife, you may deliver a soul to that afterlife
  -
- Cleanup

Delivering a soul:

- Each of the three symbols (Circle, Triangle, Square) represent virtues/deeds in life.
- In order to be accepted, a soul must meet or exceed the numbers on the dice for each of the symbols. The coloured cards match each of the colours of soul, so if you deliver a blue soul, you look at the revealed blue soul card and look at the pips on that card (the stacks on the left in the picture).
- If they don’t, each pip behind requires 2 coins.

Example:

- So if I deliver a blue soul to the top afterlife in that picture, it’s expecting:
  - 3 Square
  - 1 Circle
  - 1 Triangle
- And the revealed blue soul is:
  - 1 Square
  - 3 Circle
  - 0 Triangle
- So for me to deliver that soul, I am short 2 Squares and 1 Triangle. Thats 3 pips total, times 2, is 6 coins.
- I would score 2 points, because there is a blue square in that afterlife already.
- Then I would increment up either the Square or the Circle on that afterlife’s dice.

- Yes, you and all of the players are psychopomps.
  Each of the colours of souls represents a “family” or something.
- You want to be the go-to psychopomp for the living, and what souls want is to see their “families” in the afterlife.
- So you score points that scale with how many family members are waiting for them. (First soul of a colour in one afterlife: 1 point, Fifth soul of a colour in one afterlife: 5 points)
- But the more souls you bring to an afterlife, the more discerning (expensive) it gets.
- So the first actions/purchases to think about are probably about generating income, discounts, and more specifically moving around the mancala.
